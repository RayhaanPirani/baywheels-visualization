# Customer Behaviour Analysis from Bay Wheels Trips data

## About the dataset

In this project, we shall perform exploratory and explanatory visualization on the [Bay Wheels Trip Data](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data) provided by Lyft. We use the latest version of the data available (for March 2020, generated on April 18th).


## Findings Summary

Customers prefer to ride in short durations, with an average of 4 to 8 minutes. There are a few customers who have taken really long trips, including one who took a bike for an entire day. A bike with the ID 400679 was the most used one.

The customers prefer to be subscribed than take rides without a subscription. Customers also prefer to use the app to start and end trips rather than Clipper Cards. The San Francisco Caltrain station at Townsend St. at 4th St. is the most popular station for both starting and ending rides. Customers mostly ride in the afternoons, followed by mornings.

Both subscribed and casual customers show similar behavioral patterns. Also, customers who use the app and those who use Clipper Cards do not have significant variance in their behaviour either.


## Presentation Key Insights

For the presentation, we did not consider the outliers, like the person who used a bike for a whole day. We also ignored the most used bike and preferred to do analysis with respect to stations instead.

First, we introduced the amount of users by type (a subscriber or a casual customer), followed by their rental access method (the app or the Clipper Card). Then, we went on to show the distribution of the duration of the ride, followed by the number of rides based on the bike station.

Finally, we showed the amount of trips grouped by the time of the day for both starting and ending of the trips.
